-----------------

Rewrite standalone application with nodejs application structure:

  - package management : npm, bower
  - testing: mocha, chai, and sinon?
  - server side : may need to connect to database directly for query
  - server side : may need to handle user login
  - client side : use bootstrap for html layout
  - client side : thought about angularjs but don't think need it at this stage.

  - git: https://github.com/jinghuage/gp41_genbank_sample.git
  - branch: step-0 for empty project structure
